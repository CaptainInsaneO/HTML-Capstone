        <hr />
        <p>I am someone who is starving for success. I feel as if there are no limits as to where I can take my life. I know there is greatness within me, I just have to access it. That being said, I've spent the last 5.5 years getting a degree that I'm not even sure was worth it. That is still to be determined, but right now that's how it feels. I graduated with a bunch of student debt and really no idea what I wanted to do next. Everyone was telling me to get a job, any job will do. Just get started. That didn't sit right with me. I already spent the last five and a half years blindly going through school with no sense of purpose or direction. All I knew was that school was the key to success and without it I won't make it. But make what? Make it to a hellish 9-5, pay check to paycheck, vacation once a year, only looking to the left side of the menu, lifestyle. This couldn't be it for me. I knew there was something more out there and the life I was living was just a shell of what it could be. </p>
        <p>There is one thing I learned from College that I think changed my life forever. Minoring in Entrepreneurship introduced me to some professors that opened my mind. I started coming up with all these startup ideas. Ideas that I thought were game changers.</p>
